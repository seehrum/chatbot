Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Levenshtein library (for string similarity calculation)

Installation

    Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
    Install the Levenshtein library using pip:

    pip install python-Levenshtein

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment:

python ai_assistant_v1.0.py

Menu Options

    Train AI: Enter question-answer pairs to train the AI.
    Ask AI: Ask questions and get answers based on the training.
    Exit: Quit the application.

Training the AI

    Enter questions and corresponding answers.
    Use commands like 'menu:', 'clear:', 'exit:', 'commands:' for additional actions.

Asking Questions

    Type your question to get an answer from the AI.
    Use special commands like 'show:', 'search:', in addition to standard ones for enhanced interaction.

Configuration

Modify the constants at the beginning of the script to change settings like similarity threshold, typewriter effect, etc.
Troubleshooting

    If the AI does not respond correctly, consider training it with more data.
    Ensure the ai_data.json file is in the same directory as the script for data persistence.
